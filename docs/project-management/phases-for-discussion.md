Perfect! Now let's create a structured approach to finalize all technical decisions before development. Here's the step-by-step discussion plan:

## Phase 1: Core Technical Foundation (Priority 1) ✅ COMPLETED

### 1. Database Architecture ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ __Database Technology__: PostgreSQL for production, SQLite for development
- ✅ __Database Schema Design__: Complete unified schema with all entities and relationships
- ✅ __Data Migration Strategy__: SQLAlchemy ORM with Alembic migrations
- ✅ __Backup & Recovery__: Encrypted daily backups with 7-year retention

### 2. Project Structure & Organization ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ __Folder Structure__: Modular domain-driven design with dependency injection
- ✅ __Module Organization__: Loosely coupled modules (users, clients, cases, ai, etc.)
- ✅ __Configuration Management__: .env files for backend and frontend
- ✅ __Dependency Management__: pip-tools for Python, npm for Node.js

### 3. Authentication & Security ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ __Authentication Method__: JWT with refresh tokens, separate systems for advocates/clients
- ✅ __Authorization Model__: Role-based access control (Admin, Advocate, Client)
- ✅ __Security Standards__: Complex passwords, device tracking, token revocation
- ✅ __Compliance Requirements__: Indian legal data residency, audit logging

## Phase 2: Development Environment (Priority 2) ✅ COMPLETED

### 4. Development Setup ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ __Local Development__: Python 3.12 + venv, Docker for PostgreSQL
- ✅ __Environment Configuration__: Separate .env files, Docker Compose setup
- ✅ __Testing Strategy__: pytest + httpx for FastAPI, comprehensive test organization
- ✅ __Code Quality Tools__: Black, isort, flake8, mypy, pre-commit hooks

### 5. AI Integration Architecture

- __AI Service Provider__: OpenAI, custom models, or hybrid approach?
- __AI Features Implementation__: Case-specific AI vs Global AI assistant
- __Cost Management__: Token usage tracking and optimization
- __Fallback Strategies__: What happens when AI services fail?

## Phase 3: Deployment & Operations (Priority 3)

### 6. Deployment Strategy

- __Hosting Platform__: Cloud provider, VPS, or on-premise?
- __Containerization__: Docker setup and orchestration
- __CI/CD Pipeline__: Automated testing and deployment
- __Monitoring & Logging__: Application performance and error tracking

### 7. Scalability Planning

- __Performance Requirements__: Expected load and response times
- __Caching Strategy__: Redis, in-memory, or database caching?
- __Load Balancing__: How to handle multiple users
- __Database Scaling__: Replication, sharding strategies

## Discussion Order & Timeline

__Week 1: Foundation Decisions__

1. Database technology and schema design
2. Project structure and folder organization
3. Authentication and security architecture

__Week 2: Development Setup__ 4. Development environment and tooling 5. AI integration architecture and providers 6. Testing strategy and quality assurance

__Week 3: Deployment Planning__ 7. Deployment strategy and hosting decisions 8. Monitoring, logging, and maintenance procedures

## Questions to Start With:

1. __Database__: What's your preference for database technology? Any existing constraints?
2. __Hosting__: Do you have preferences for cloud providers or hosting approach?
3. __AI Services__: Are you planning to use OpenAI API, or considering other AI providers?
4. __Timeline__: What's your target timeline for the demo to advocates?
5. __Team Size__: Will you be developing solo or with a team?

Which area would you like to start discussing first? I recommend beginning with database architecture since it affects everything else.
