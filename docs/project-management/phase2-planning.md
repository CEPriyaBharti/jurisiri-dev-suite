## Overview
This document outlines Phase 2 planning for JuriSiri, focusing on AI integration architecture and deployment strategy. Phase 1 (Database, Project Structure, Authentication, Development Environment) has been completed.

## Phase 2: AI Integration & Advanced Features

### 5. AI Integration Architecture

#### AI Service Provider Decision

- **Anthropic Claude** (Claude-3)
- **Google Gemini** (Gemini Pro)
- **Azure OpenAI** (Enterprise features)
- **Local Models** (Ollama, LM Studio)
- **Hybrid Approach** (Multiple providers)

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Cost per token and usage limits
- Response quality for legal content
- API reliability and uptime
- Data privacy and compliance
- Rate limiting and scaling
- Integration complexity

#### AI Features Implementation
**Two-Tier AI System:**

**1. Case-Specific AI Assistant**
- Context-aware legal consultation
- Case document analysis
- Legal strategy development
- Practice mode (AI opponent)
- Case-specific knowledge base

**2. Global AI Assistant**
- Cross-platform automation
- Natural language queries
- Task automation (calendar, reminders)
- Progress summaries
- General legal assistance

#### Cost Management Strategy
**Token Usage Tracking:**
- Per-organization usage monitoring
- User-level usage analytics
- Cost allocation and billing
- Usage alerts and limits
- Optimization recommendations

**Cost Optimization:**
- Prompt engineering for efficiency
- Response caching for common queries
- Model selection based on complexity
- Batch processing for bulk operations
- Fallback to cheaper models when appropriate

#### Fallback Strategies
**AI Service Failures:**
- Multiple provider fallback chain
- Cached responses for common queries
- Graceful degradation to basic features
- User notification of service issues
- Manual override capabilities

### Technical Implementation Details

#### AI Session Management
```sql
-- Enhanced AI session tracking
ai_sessions (
    id, organization_id, user_id, case_id,
    session_type, provider, model_used,
    token_count, cost, messages, 
    created_at, completed_at
)

ai_usage_tracking (
    id, organization_id, user_id, date,
    total_tokens, total_cost, session_count,
    provider_breakdown
)
```

#### AI Service Architecture
```python
# AI Service Provider Interface
class AIProvider:
    def generate_response(prompt, context, model)
    def estimate_cost(prompt, model)
    def check_availability()
    def get_usage_stats()

# Provider Implementations
class OpenAIProvider(AIProvider)
class AnthropicProvider(AIProvider)
class LocalModelProvider(AIProvider)

# AI Service Manager
class AIServiceManager:
    def route_request(request, preferences)
    def handle_fallback(failed_provider, request)
    def track_usage(session, response)
    def optimize_costs(usage_pattern)
```

#### Integration Points
- **Case Management**: AI insights on case strategy
- **Document Processing**: AI-powered document analysis
- **Client Communication**: AI-generated updates and summaries
- **Legal Research**: AI-assisted research and precedent finding
- **Practice Management**: AI-driven workflow optimization

## Phase 3: Deployment & Operations

### 6. Deployment Strategy

#### Hosting Platform Options
**Cloud Providers:**
- **AWS**: Comprehensive services, legal compliance features
- **Google Cloud**: AI/ML integration, competitive pricing
- **Azure**: Enterprise features, Microsoft ecosystem
- **DigitalOcean**: Simple, cost-effective for startups
- **Linode/Vultr**: Budget-friendly VPS options

**Deployment Models:**
- **Containerized Deployment** (Docker + Kubernetes)
- **Serverless Architecture** (AWS Lambda, Vercel)
- **Traditional VPS** (Simple, cost-effective)
- **Hybrid Approach** (Static frontend + API backend)

#### Containerization Strategy
**Docker Setup:**
- Multi-stage builds for optimization
- Separate containers for API, web, database
- Environment-specific configurations
- Health checks and monitoring
- Security scanning and updates

**Orchestration:**
- **Development**: Docker Compose
- **Production**: Kubernetes or Docker Swarm
- **Auto-scaling**: Based on load and usage
- **Load balancing**: Nginx or cloud load balancers

#### CI/CD Pipeline
**Automated Workflow:**
1. Code commit triggers pipeline
2. Automated testing (unit, integration, E2E)
3. Security scanning and vulnerability checks
4. Build and push Docker images
5. Deploy to staging environment
6. Automated testing in staging
7. Manual approval for production
8. Blue-green deployment to production
9. Post-deployment monitoring and alerts

### 7. Scalability Planning

#### Performance Requirements
**Target Metrics:**
- API response time: < 200ms (95th percentile)
- Database query time: < 50ms average
- AI response time: < 5 seconds
- Concurrent users: 100+ per organization
- Uptime: 99.9% availability

#### Caching Strategy
**Multi-Level Caching:**
- **Application Cache**: Redis for session data
- **Database Cache**: Query result caching
- **CDN Cache**: Static assets and API responses
- **AI Response Cache**: Common AI responses
- **Browser Cache**: Frontend asset caching

#### Load Balancing
**Traffic Distribution:**
- **API Load Balancer**: Distribute API requests
- **Database Read Replicas**: Scale read operations
- **Geographic Distribution**: CDN for global access
- **Auto-scaling**: Dynamic resource allocation

#### Database Scaling
**Scaling Strategy:**
- **Vertical Scaling**: Increase server resources
- **Read Replicas**: Distribute read operations
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimize database connections
- **Query Optimization**: Index optimization and query tuning
- **Partitioning**: Partition large tables by organization
